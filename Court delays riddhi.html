  <p> The pandemic not just affected businesses and the economy, it also overloaded the already burdened British justice system. </p>

  <p> The number of live caseload with the prosecution at both, the magistrate and the crown court went up from 98,392 in April 2019 to 165,157 in March 2021, increasing by 68% overall. </p>

</script>

<p> This backlog resulted in hearings being delayed, rescheduled or cancelled often and while the cases that would earlier take less than four hearings for conclusion, started being pushed beyond six in many cases. </p>

<p> The higher time taken to process a case at each step by the crown courts escalated the human cost, as victims of rape and domestic abuse had to wait longer to get justice. In some regions, like London South, it took on an average 196 days for the crown courts to make a pre-charge decision in rape cases in 2020-21, whereas this number was 95 days in 2018-19. </p>

<p> Even the people held on suspicion of guilt where kept on remand, both on bail and in the prisons, for a longer period as the wait times for them increased manifold. This meant that their civil liberties, especially for those pleading not guilty, were curtailed for a longer period, impacting their mental health and wellbeing. </P>

<p> A <a href= "https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/172/constitution-committee/news/153596/report-published-on-the-impact-of-covid19-on-courts-and-tribunals-in-england-and-wales/"> report published by the Constitution Committee </a> about the impact of pandemic on courts and tribunals in 30th March 2021, presented the following key findings: </p>

<ol>
<li> In the decade before the pandemic, the government funding reduced significantly, with legal budgets cut and court buildings closed. This magnified the crisis when the pandemic hit, as the courts were unable to cope with the volume of cases </li>
<li> Remote hearings during the pandemic, while being the only feasible solution, brought significant technological challanges as not every court and vulnerable litigants were able to adapt to it </li>
<li> The interruption to regular operations had a negative impact on public funds available for those who could not afford legal representation. The report called on the government to increase the legal aid to reduce the barriers faced by lower income groups to get a fair trial </li>
<li> The courts may take several years to clear the backlog of criminal, family and employment cases to return to the pre-pandemic levels. </li>
<li> There is still a great of data that isn't available on the fuctioning of the courts, and the report recommends that the government trigger a data reform so the real impact of remote hearings can be ascertained. </li>
