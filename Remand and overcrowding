    <h2>remand total</h2>
    <p>According to the prisoner rights charity,<a href="https://www.fairtrials.org/news/one-ten-remand-population%C2%A0-england-and%C2%A0wales%C2%A0have-been-prison-more-year%C2%A0" target="_blank"> Fair Trials </a>, there are currently 3949 remand prisoners that have been heald for longer than the six month limit.
    This makes up nearly 5% of the UK's entire prison population of roughly 87,500. </p>

   var chart = c3.generate({
        bindto: '#chart',
        data: {
          columns: [
            ['remanded more than 6 months', 4.5],
            ['general remand population', 11.5],
            ['sentenced population', 84]
          ],

    });

<p>Ironically, Fair trials claim that the delays are getting so bad that some defendants are needlessly pleading guilty in order to get out of prison because the time spent behind
bars has already exceeded the maximum sentence carried by their alleged crimes.</p>

<h2>crowding over time</h2>
<p>The UK's prison population has been <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/314700/uk-prison-population/#:~:text=As%20of%202021%2C%20there%20were,1.4%20thousand%20in%20Northern%20Ireland." target="_blank">
  steadily increasing</a>since the Second World War. Whilst the general population has also <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/articles/overviewoftheukpopulation/january2021" target="_blank">increased</a>, the increase in the prison population far exceeds
  the relative growth. </p>

  var chart = c3.generate({
    bindto: '#population_growth',
    data: {
        columns: [
            ['prison population', 22255, 22920, 44031, 47124, 49699, 71553, 94044, 89132],

        }
    },
});

</div>
<p>It is worth noting that the overall prison population has fallen over the last year due to the court delays caused by the pandemic.</p>
