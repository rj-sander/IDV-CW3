<p>
  It is interesting that while prisoners on remand represent the 2nd largest population of prisoners, they are only the 4th most expensive on an individual basis. <br>
  However, there is a difference between the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/prison-performance-statistics-2019-to-2020"> yearly price for a male and female prisoner on remand</a>. For a male prisoner the cost is of £43 503 per year and £119 per day whereas for a female prisoner it is £57 819 per year and £158 per day. <br>
  The total resource expenditure reported to take care of for prisoners on remand was £1 357 359 340 in 2019-20.
