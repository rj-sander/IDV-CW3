        <p>The Covid-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on the British justice system. Whilst overall crime fell over the lockdown periods, the court system also ground to a halt. Concerns over potentially unfair trials meant that hearings could not move
          online and this caused some defendants to have to wait unprecedented lengths before they could have their cases heard. This dashboard delves into some of the issues that have arisen from these delays and illustrates how far reaching the
          problem really is.</p>

            <p> The higher time taken to process a case at each step by the crown courts escalated the human cost, as victims of rape and domestic abuse had to wait longer to get justice. In some regions, like London South, it took on an average 196
              days for the crown courts to make a pre-charge decision in rape cases in 2020-21, whereas this number was 95 days in 2018-19. </p>

              remand prisoners that have been heald for longer than the six month limit. This makes up nearly 5% of the UK's entire prison population of roughly 87,500.<br><br>Ironically, Fair trials claim that the delays are getting so bad that some
              defendants are needlessly pleading guilty in order to get out of prison because the time spent behind bars has already exceeded the maximum sentence carried by their alleged crimes. The legal time limit for a person to be held on remand
              is six months. This was <a href="https://www.fairtrials.org/news/uk-government-ends-custody-time-limit-extension-england-and-wales" target="_blank">extended</a> to eight months during the pandemic in September 2020, but this was removed

                target="_blank">increased</a>, the increase in the prison population far exceeds the relative growth. It is worth noting that the overall prison population has fallen over the last year due to the court delays caused by the pandemic.

        <h2>Overcrowded Prisons</h2>
        <p>This map shows every prison in England and Wales that is currently running at above its original capacity. All told, this accounts for over half of the prisons in the country and does not include those running at 100% capacity. The data
          comes from a <a href=” https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04334/SN04334.pdf” target=”_blank”>House of Commons report</a> from October of 2021. Scotland and Northern Ireland were not included in the data, but <a href=”

          that the problem doe extend north of the border, with over 104 inmates per every 100 places in Scottish prisons. Northern Ireland bucks the trend by continuing to run well below capacity. This is largely due to the decline in hostilities
          meaning less people are arrested for sectarian crimes. The Good Friday Agreement also saw the
          <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/northern_ireland/understanding/themes/prisoner_release.stm target=”_blank”release of 500</a> loyalist and republican offenders, the equivalent of more than a third of NI’s entire current

            <p>Prisoners on remand are unconvicted prisoners meaning they have rights they can still exert in prison. For instance, prisoners on remand can <a

              well as being involved with a running, legal business. <br>It is interesting that while prisoners on remand represent the 2nd largest population of prisoners, they are only the 4th most expensive on an individual basis.<br>However,
              there is a difference between the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/prison-performance-statistics-2019-to-2020"> yearly price for a male and female prisoner on remand</a>. For a male prisoner the cost is of £43 503 per

              about the impact of pandemic on courts and tribunals in 30th March 2021, presented the following key findings: </p>
            <ol>
              <li> In the decade before the pandemic, the government funding reduced significantly, with legal budgets cut and court buildings closed. This magnified the crisis when the pandemic hit, as the courts were unable to cope with the volume
                of cases </li>
              <li> Remote hearings during the pandemic, while being the only feasible solution, brought significant technological challanges as not every court and vulnerable litigants were able to adapt to it </li>
              <li> The interruption to regular operations had a negative impact on public funds available for those who could not afford legal representation. The report called on the government to increase the legal aid to reduce the barriers faced
                by lower income groups to get a fair trial </li>
              <li> The courts may take several years to clear the backlog of criminal, family and employment cases to return to the pre-pandemic levels. </li>
              <li> There is still a great of data that isn't available on the fuctioning of the courts, and the report recommends that the government trigger a data reform so the real impact of remote hearings can be ascertained. </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div class="uk-tile uk-tile-default">
            <p>To reduce the backlog temporarily, 72 Nightingale courtrooms were started between July 2020 and July 2021 across all jurisdictions in three phases, that served as extensions of existing courts but in different venues. Many of these
              are expected to function till March 2022, and judges have seen a positive impact of this system, without which the outstanding cases would have been higher by 4470 cases in April 2021. Recently, in the most significant change to the
              legal system, the magistrates' courts are being given the power to sentence a criminal for upto one year, which was six months earlier, to further reduce the burden on the crown courts. </p>
