Step 1: Acquiring Data

Data Points to Investigate:
- How many cases are resolved that day as a percentage [Bex]
- Which London Crown Court has the most delays [Rhiddi]
- How many poeple are on remand right now awaiting trials [Joe]
- What is the financial cost of the prison system? How much does it cost to hold some one on remand, how many days of work get missed, e.g. [Tom]
- What kinds of cases are being heard, is there a pattern in which ones are being resolved faster/slower? [Yuta]

Other possible data points:
- Prison overcrowding
- How COVID has affected delays, comparisons between 2021 and 2018 e.g.
- Creating a map of London Prisons
